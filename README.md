# Readable: A content and comment Web App

## Project Overview
In the Readable project, I created an app where the users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.
This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React and Redux course. For this project, I used `create-react-app` as a starter template.

## How to run the application
- Download the repository in your desktop and unzip it
- Open your terminal and run `npm install` and `npm start`
- This project also use a node server. So you will need to run `node server` in you terminal as well

## Backend Server

To simplify our development process, Udacity provided a backend server for us to develop against. The provided file [`node server`](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)  contains the methods we needed to perform necessary operations on the backend.
